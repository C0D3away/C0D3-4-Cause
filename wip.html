<h2>How cryptocurrency should be, and what it should be used for...</h2>
<p>The future of software is in digital currency. Software developers could sell their software for digital currency, and exchange that digital currency for cash. The software customers could ask a developer to make him a software he needs, and the dev will sell the customer the software.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The customers earn cryptocurrency by mining. About every hour the user earns .01dc (digital currency). Over time he could build up enough dc to buy software. 1dc = 1$. So every 10hrs the user gets a dollar in dc. Video games could be sold in dc, therefore forcing gamers to play the game until they have enough dc to buy another one.</p>
<br/>
<p>What people are doing with cryptocurrency now is mining it and exchanging it for money, or saving it for later on. It's kind of a greedy thing in my opinion. I see cryptocurrency stores being made. Where people would mine for cryptocurrency and spend it on video games, photos, videos, software, and other digital data. God it could even replace current US and European currrency, although that idea does sound pretty stupid.
